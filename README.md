NFL Draft Simulator with AI
An advanced NFL draft simulator that uses Bayesian networks, fuzzy logic, and machine learning elements to make intelligent and realistic draft decisions.

üìã Description

This project implements a comprehensive NFL draft simulator that mimics the decision-making process of real teams. Using advanced artificial intelligence techniques, the system evaluates prospects based on:

- Player rankings (prospect quality)
- Team-specific needs
- Historical draft selection patterns by position and round

The combination of Bayesian networks to model historical probabilities, fuzzy logic to simulate human reasoning, and machine learning elements for optimization creates a system capable of making realistic selections and providing reasoning behind each decision.

‚ú® Features

Bayesian Network: Learns from historical data to calculate selection probabilities by position and round
Fuzzy Logic System: Implements linguistic rules like "if need is high and ranking is elite, then fit is high"
Interactive Dashboard: Streamlit graphical interface to visualize and analyze results
Customization: Allows modification of team needs and factor weights
Advanced Visualizations: Charts, diagrams, and heat maps for detailed analysis
Complete Simulation: Ability to simulate all 257+ picks of the draft

üöÄ Installation
bash# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/nfl-draft-simulator.git
cd nfl-draft-simulator

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

üìä Usage
Console Simulator
For a quick demonstration through the console:
bashpython example_simulator.py
This script showcases the basic capabilities of the simulator, including probability calculation, fit scores, and pick simulation.
Interactive Dashboard
For the complete experience with graphical interface:
bashstreamlit run dashboard.py
The dashboard allows you to:

Configure the number of picks to simulate
Customize decision factor weightings
Modify team needs
Visualize results with interactive charts
Analyze data by team, position, and round
